### Introduction
Hello! My name is Lex! I am from Indiana and I am enrolled into Ivy Tech and am currently working towards my Cyber Security degree!
I have two cats and a dog at home and I work at an animal shelter with even more animals. I enjoy the job and it is very rewarding helping our animals!
